\f0\fs24 \cf0 When data is skewed or contains outliers, the median is a better summary than the mean because it is not significantly impacted by extreme values, providing a more accurate representation of the "typical" data point, while the mean can be pulled drastically towards the outlier, distorting the central tendency. \
In our case, the variance is significant so using the median could give a more accurate analysis.\
The successful campaigns have more variability compared to the unsuccessful campaigns. It could be explained by the fact that the unsuccessful campaigns have a smaller sample.}
